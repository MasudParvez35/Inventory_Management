This inventory management system, resembling an e-commerce platform, is built using C#, .NET, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, and follows the Onion architecture. It allows users to manage their favorite products by adding them to a cart or wishlist, with the option to move items from the wishlist to the cart before placing orders. The admin dashboard provides insights into total users, orders, categories, products, and sales. Admins can manage orders by updating their status from "pending" to "complete." The system is designed with clean code principles for efficient inventory management.
